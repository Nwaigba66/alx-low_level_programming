0x0A. C - argc, argv

*How to use arguments passed to your program?
Arguments to main provide a useful opportunity to give parameters to programs. 
Typically, this facility is used to direct the way the program goes about its task.
It's particularly common to provide file names to a program through its arguments.

The declaration of main looks like this:

int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
