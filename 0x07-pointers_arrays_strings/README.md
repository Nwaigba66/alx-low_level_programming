*0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

What are pointers to pointers and how to use them:

A pointer is a variable which contains a memory address. 
A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection, or a chain of pointers.
Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable.
When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer,
which points to the location that contains the actual value.

*For this documentation, we will assign the following signatures/protypes below to their type of functions:
File: 0-memset.c: A function that fills memory with a constant byte.

File: 1-memcpy.c: A function that copies memory area.

File: 2-strchr.c: A function that locates a character in a string.

File: 3-strspn.c: A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

File: 4-strpbrk.c: A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

File: 5-strstr.c: A function that locates a substring.

File: 7-print_chessboard.c: A function that prints the chessboard.

File: 8-print_diagsums.c: A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

File: 100-set_string.c: A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

File: 101-crackme_password: A file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable
