# What is a hash function?
- Hash functions have a wide range of applications. They are commonly used in hash tables, cryptographic algorithms,
 checksums, data integrity verification, digital signatures, and more.
 The choice of a hash function depends on the specific requirements of the application, including considerations such as speed,
 collision resistance, security, and distribution of hash values.
