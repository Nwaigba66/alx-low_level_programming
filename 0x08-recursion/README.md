ALX 0x08. C - Recursion

*What is recursion?
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages,
if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

*In what situations you should implement recursion
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems,
such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.

*For this tasks will write the following functions in the files below:

File: 0-puts_recursion.c: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

File: 1-print_rev_recursion.c: A function that prints a string in reverse.

File: 2-strlen_recursion.c: A function that returns the length of a string.

File: 3-factorial.c: A function that returns the factorial of a given number.

File: 4-pow_recursion.c: A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

File: 5-sqrt_recursion.c: A function that returns the natural square root of a number.

File: 6-is_prime_number.c: A function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

File: 100-is_palindrome.c: A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

File: 101-wildcmp.c: A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
