ALX C - Variadic functions

*What are variadic functions

Variadic functions are functions in computer programming languages that can accept a variable number of arguments or parameters.
In other words, these functions can take an indefinite number of arguments,
which can be useful in situations where the number of arguments required may vary.

*Variadic functions are typically defined using an ellipsis symbol (...) in the function declaration,
indicating that the function can accept any number of arguments.

*Variadic functions are commonly used in C, C++, Java, and many other programming languages
to implement functions that can take a variable number of arguments, such as printf() and scanf() in C.

*Why and how to use the const type qualifier?

The const type qualifier is used in C and C++ to indicate that a variable or pointer should not be modified after its initialization. 
This helps ensure that the value of the variable or the memory pointed to by the pointer remains constant
and cannot be changed accidentally or intentionally.
