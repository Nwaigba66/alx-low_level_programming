#0x12. C - Singly linked lists

#Data Structures:
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

#When and why using linked lists vs arrays
The linked list is a data structure that links each node to the next node.
The developer can use the linked list in the following use cases.

When the developer needs constant time for insertion and deletion.
When the data dynamically grows.
Do not access random elements from the linked list.
Insert the element in any position of the list.

#Array

The array is a data structure to store the same type of elements continuously.
The developer can use an array in the following use cases.

Need access to the elements using the index.
Know the size of the array before defining the memory.
Speed when iterating through all the elements in the sequence.
The array takes less memory compare than a linked list.

#Doubly linked lists
Doubly linked is a data structure in which each node contains data and two links.
One link point to the previous node and another link point to the next node.
The developer can use a doubly linked list in the following uses cases.

Easier to delete the node from the doubly linked list.
It can be iterated in reverse order without recursion implementation.
Insert or remove from double-linked lists faster.

#For the following projects will use the following files and functions:
File 0. Print list: A function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

File 1. List length: A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list. 

File 2. Add node: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

File 3. Add node at the end: A function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

File 4. Free list: A function that frees a list_t list

File 5. The Hare and the Tortoise: A  function that prints

File 6. Real programmers: A  64-bit program in assembly that prints
