0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

*What are pointers and how to use them
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location.
Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.

*How to use Pointers
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently.
(a) We define a pointer variable, 
(b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and
 (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable.
This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.

*File 0-reset_to_98.c:
is a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

*File 1-swap.c:
is a function that swaps the values of two integers.

*File 2-strlen.c:
a function that returns the length of a string.

*File 3-puts.c:
is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

*File 4-print_rev.c:
is a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

*File 5-rev_string.c:
is a function that reverses a string.

*File 6-puts2.c:
is a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

*File 7-puts_half.c:
is a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

*File 8-print_array.c:
is a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

*File 9-strcpy.c:
is a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

*File 100-atoi.c:
is function that convert a string to an integer.

*File 101-keygen.c:
is a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme
